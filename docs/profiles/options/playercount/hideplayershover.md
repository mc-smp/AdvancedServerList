# HidePlayersHover

The `hidePlayersHover` is a boolean that sets wether the hover on the player count should be displayed or not.  
When set to true will hovering over the player count with your cursor show nothing. This will also disable the [`hover`](hover.md) option.

## Example

```yaml
priority: 0

motd:
  - '<grey>'
  - '<grey>'

playerCount:
  hidePlayersHover: true
```
/// html | div.result
No example image to show :C
